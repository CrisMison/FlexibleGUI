1.  Overview
    All memory allocated in FlexibleGUI kernel is allocated by the memory pool strategy(mempool). Mempool have many
    different types, defined as MEMPOOL_TYPE_IDX:
        typedef enum
        {
            MEMPOOL_WINDOW,     /* Mempool for windows node */
            MEMPOOL_MAX,
        }MEMPOOL_TYPE_IDX;

    The benifits of mempool strategy are: 
    *   Mempool is a good strategy for moniting the memory usage of the FlexibleGUI kernel, which is important to know
        the shortcoming of kernel, and optimizating continuously
    *   Mempool is a good way to monite whether there is a illegal memory access which is out of control by the mempool.
    *   Mempool is a good framework in other project which need to replace the management strategy of memory in the 
        specify architecture planning, because mempool abstraced a layer for doing that.

2.  How to use the memory pool
    There are some important function of the mempool, which can be called in the kernel, as memtioned above, all memory
    allocated or freed in the FlexibleGUI kernel are by following interface. We can find out that the iPoolIdx in parameter 
    is essitail. Every memory-operated step must specify the memory pool
        FG_PTR   fg_alloc_memory(FG_INT32 iPoolIdx, FG_INT32 iSize);
        FG_INT32 fg_free_memory(FG_INT32 iPoolIdx, FG_PTR pAddr);

    The size is aligned by MEMPOOL_BLOCK_ALIGN inside the interface, which is default to 16 bytes. If the size you want isn't
    aligned by MEMPOOL_BLOCK_ALIGN, finally you will get a 16 bytes aligned memory instead and returnd by retval.

    Once the memory allocated successfully, it will allocated a r/w memory from VA(or PA in some embedded system) by "malloc",
    and be recorded in the mempool for management.

    Once you want free the memory allocated by function "fg_alloc_memory", you need transfer the pointer to "fg_free_memory",
    it will detect whether the pointer is recorded by the specific mempool.

3.  Warning & Notice
    *   When developing or modifing the kernel, all functions that can allocated memory or maped memory are strictlly forbid 
        except for functions defined in mempool, or others listed below.
            a)
            b)
            c)
    *   Pay attention to the log printed by mempool, it must be the highest level error in the FlexibleGUI kernel
